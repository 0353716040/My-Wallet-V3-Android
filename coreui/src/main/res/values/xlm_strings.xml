    <string name="minimum_balance_body">Stellar requires that all Stellar accounts hold a minimum balance of lumens, or XLM. This means you cannot send a balance out of your Stellar Wallet that would leave your Stellar Wallet with less than the minimum balance. This also means that in order to send XLM to a new Stellar account, you must send enough XLM to meet the minimum balance requirement.

The current minimum balance requirement is 1 XLM.</string>
